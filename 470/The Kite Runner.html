											<h3>The Kite Runner</h3>
											<p> â€œIt may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime." Amir is the son of a wealthy Kabul merchant, a member of the ruling caste of Pashtuns. Hassan, his servant and constant companion, is a Hazara, a despised and impoverished caste. Their uncommon bond is torn by Amir's choice to abandon his friend amidst the increasing ethnic.</p>

						     <p>The Kite Runner is primarily an example of historical fiction in that it is set against a backdrop of historic events in Afghanistan, from the collapse of the monarchy to the rise and fall of the Taliban. As a genre, historical fiction focuses on a particular setting and the social conditions of the time period.
</p>
		<p>The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini narrates the story of two boys Amir and Hassan in the backdrop of war torn Afghanistan. The book deals with the themes of guilt and redemption. Well I was left teary eyed after reading the book. The story is really powerful and leaves a strong impact on you , an ardent reader.</p>
